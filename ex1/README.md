Write a city class representing a city. It must have the following attributes: -name: the name of the city in question (eg Paris)
-Department: the city department in the form of an integer
The value of attributes is determined in a constructor
To this class, you will add the following methods:
- a show_location () method: it displays a string in the terminal indicating the name of the city and its location, for example it shows: "the city X is in the department Y"
- a method change_location (): it expects two parameters, a name in the form of a string and a department in the form of integer. It assigns to the object the new values ​​of the name and the department
Create at least 5 city objects, assign their properties, and use the display method. Then call the change_location method on one of them and verify that its coordinates have been changed.
Be careful your city class is stored in a separate file and called in a main.py file.
