You will take back the class previously created and improve it a little. Indeed, what would happen if our city class had dozens of attributes? It would quickly become chaotic. Can not have so many attributes? Think for 5 minutes about all the characteristics of a city: name, department, population, country, postal code, name of inhabitants, date of creation, leader, famous characters etc ...
In the folder you have been given, you will find a cities.py file that contains a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary represents a city.
It's up to you to modify your city class so that its constructor accepts a dictionary as an argument and hydrates all the attributes at once.
You will add a show_information () method which displays the complete identity card of the city, ie all of its information.
In your main.py file, then loop to instantiate all cities at once and display their IDs
To go further, make sure that if one of your dictionaries contains keys that should not be present in your object then the corresponding attribute is not created. A clue, look for the hasattr and setattr methods.
