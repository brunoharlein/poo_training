In this exercise, you will model a very simple library and a reader who borrows a book and reads it. To help you, empty class files have been given to you along with a file containing a list of books. You will also find a main.py file with a pre-written code execution script. Your goal is to make this code work without changes.
Your program will consist of the following objects:
- The book, it consists of a title, the default page number on which we are and a list of pages. For simplicity, in the books_list file, you will see that it is simply written 'page1', 'page2' etc. As part of a real application these character strings would be much longer and would also contain formatting and newlines. Be careful the books_list file does not contain the book objects, it contains the data of the books to be entered in objects, to you to code the Book class accordingly.
- The library, it simply contains the list of book objects, just as a real-world library is just a warehouse for a book. She can add books to her catalog and return the corresponding book object on the basis of a title.
- The reader, it contains only the book he borrowed. He can perform several actions. He can borrow a book, go to a specific page of the book, go to the next page, go to the previous page, read a page that is to say display its content on the screen and finally read the entire book.
